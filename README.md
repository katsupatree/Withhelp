#Withhelp
##My second attempt for creating a new git repo.
git init
echo "reponame" >> README.md
git add (filename or .)
###. is all
git commit -m "add here"
### all comits must have a message
### set git account
git remote add origin (url) https://github.com/katsupatree/Withhelp.git
git push -u origin master
### sends to git


On a new comp to download repo use above workflow
To pull down new files/info in same repo use
~~~git pull origin master
~~~

#Notes
Important that you enter into the right directory before "git init". When you git pull on a repo it will deposit everything into the initiated file that your in.


This is the 3rd comp I have worked on with vaired success.
